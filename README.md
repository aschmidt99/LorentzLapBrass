The Lorentz Lap Brass is a new Electromagnetically Actuated Musical Instrument/Interface (EMAII) that uses the principles of Lorentz (or Laplace) Force to enable actuation of brass strings. This style of actuation is uncommon in musical instruments, though it presents rich opportunity for cost-effective tactile feedback, infinite sustain,and feedback control.
In an effort to encourage open-source knowledge sharing, replication, and adoption of this novel technique, this page describes the underlying concepts, designs, and techniques for this method. Schematics, CAD, and code used in the setup are described.

You can find a video demo of the setup here: [https://youtu.be/jn6EsgfvfKE?si=S7AA26RQ-fFISa5W)https://youtu.be/jn6EsgfvfKE?si=S7AA26RQ-fFISa5W](url)
